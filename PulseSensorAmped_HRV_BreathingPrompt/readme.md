This sketch will give you a breathing prompt in the upper right hand section of the screen.
You can change the period of the prompt by pressing the number keys on your keyboard

The oval changes color and size to prompt a breath in and out for the cycle time.

## IBI Tracking

The lower right window tracks the value between the peak and trough in the IBI window (left window). This is measured in milliseconds, and is a relative number.

This code is build on the PulseSensorAmped_HRV_FequencyDomain code contained in this repo.

No claims or promises of efficacity are made. WYSIWYG. Have fun!
