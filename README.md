This repo contains Processing Sketches that explore Heart Rate Variability (HRV).

These sketches work with Arduino running PulseSensor BPM code and plugged into PulseSensor hardware. Follow the tutorial [HERE](https://pulsesensor.com/pages/getting-advanced) to get your Arduino set up to read the Pulse Sensor signal and output data to these sketches.

A thorough description of HRV and explication of these sketches are here
